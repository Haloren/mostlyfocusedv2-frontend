# IMPORTANT!
This project is the front-end to work along with the Rails backend found here:
### https://github.com/Haloren/mostlyfocusedv2-backend
### To start clone the rails backend (https://github.com/Haloren/mostlyfocusedv2-backend) and run the rails server using port 3001
- Run the following command in your terminal: `rails s -p 3001` 

## Once the Rails Backend server is running you can clone and start the App

- To start run the following command in your terminal: `npm start`
The app will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

# How to Use this App
## Help keep yourself mostly focused by setting this as your home page, that way everytime you open a new tab or winodw you'll be reminded of current Todos and upcoming Events.
- Add and Delete Todos and Events
- Check the Weather with a glance and set to your desired City
